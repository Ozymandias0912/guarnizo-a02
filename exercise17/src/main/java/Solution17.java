/*
 * Pseudocode
 * Create variables for the program:
 * Alcohol (in oz)
 * Weight (in pounds)
 * Ratio (alcohol distribution ratio)
 * ratio1 for men and ratio2 for women (0.73 for men and 0.66 for women)
 * Hours (since last drink)
 *
 * Print to the screen: " Enter a 1 is you are male or a 2 if you are female: "
 * Check if the input was an integer
 * If it was a string then:
 * Print to the screen: " "string" is not a valid input, try again."
 * Exit program
 * Else:
 *
 * If ( input == 1)
 * Then:
 *       Print to the screen: "How many ounces of alcohol did you have? "
 *       Save input in Alcohol
 *       Print to the screen: "What is your weight, in pounds? "
 *       Save input in Weight
 *       Print to the screen: "How many hours has it been since your last drink? "
 *       Save input in Hours
 *       Calculate BAC =( (Alcohol * 5.14) / (Weight * ratio1) ) - (0.15 * Hours)
 *
 *       Print to the screen: "Your BAC is "BAC" "
 *       If ( BAC <= 0.08)
 *       Then:
 *             Print to the screen: "It is legal for you to drive. "
 *       Else:
 *             Print to the screen: "It is not legal for you to drive. "
 * Else:
 *       If( input == 2 )
 *       Then:
 *       Print to the screen: "How many ounces of alcohol did you have? "
 *       Save input in Alcohol
 *       Print to the screen: "What is your weight, in pounds? "
 *       Save input in Weight
 *       Print to the screen: "How many hours has it been since your last drink? "
 *       Save input in Hours
